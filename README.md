# Plus 5 to hit - Initiative Tracker

If your Game Master screen has creature notes like this...

> "The Chomper - giant "fish", looks like boulder, swims/eats through mountain rock, pops into cave. multi-a +5 1d6 slash 1d8 pierc, DC12 acrob/athlet save or restrained"

...this initiative tracker might be for you.

It is not meant to replace complete character sheets, monster books or a VTT. It's an initiative tracker to keep a birds eye overview during combat.

It's as quick and easy as working with post-it notes or whiteboard magnets, but better.

Two-monitor split view: One view with all your notes faces you, the game master; a reduced, larger tracker faces your players.
